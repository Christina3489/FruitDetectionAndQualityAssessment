# FruitDetectionAndQualityAssessment
Ensuring an AI-based application designed for consumers to identify fruit and quality efficiently and accurately.
Introduction
This project aims to develop a system for identifying and classifying various fruits using image processing and machine learning techniques. The system can recognize multiple fruit types from images and classify them into predefined categories.

# Features
Fruit Identification: Detects and identifies individual fruits in an image.
Fruit Classification: Classifies detected fruits into specific categories such as apples, oranges, bananas, etc.
Scalable Architecture: Easy to add new fruit categories with minimal adjustments.
User Interface: Provides a simple user interface for uploading images and viewing results.

# Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow 2.x
Keras
NumPy
OpenCV
Matplotlib
scikit-learn

# Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
[git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fruit-identification-classification.git](https://github.com/Christina3489/FruitDetectionAndQualityAssessment)
cd fruit-identification-classification
Create a virtual environment and activate it:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install the required packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage

# Preparing the Dataset:

Place your dataset in the data/ directory. The dataset should be organized into subdirectories for each fruit category, with each subdirectory containing images of that fruit.
Training the Model:

# Run the training script:
bash
Copy code
python train.py

# Testing the Model:

Run the testing script:
bash
Copy code
python test.py
Using the Model for Prediction:

Use the provided interface to upload images and get predictions.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project should include a variety of fruit images, organized into folders by fruit type. Each folder should contain images of that specific fruit. The dataset should be split into train, validation, and test sets.

# Model Architecture
The model is built using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, which is well-suited for image classification tasks. The architecture includes multiple convolutional layers followed by pooling layers, and finally, fully connected layers leading to the output.

# Training the Model
Data Augmentation: To improve model generalization, data augmentation techniques such as rotation, zooming, and flipping are applied.
Model Compilation: The model is compiled with the categorical crossentropy loss function and the Adam optimizer.
Training: The model is trained on the training dataset with validation using the validation dataset.
Testing and Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using the test dataset. Key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are computed to assess the model's effectiveness.
