# Fruit Classification User Manual

# Introduction
The Fruit Classification project is a machine learning application designed to classify different types of fruits using a trained model. This manual provides comprehensive instructions for setting up, running, and using the application, whether you are a developer, tester, or end-user.

# System Requirements
Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux
Python Version: 3.6 or higher
Docker: (Optional) If you prefer using a containerized environment

# Installation and Setup
Cloning the Repository
To get started, you need to clone the repository from GitHub.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fruit-classification.git
cd fruit-classification

# Setting Up the Environment
Ensure you have Python installed. Set up a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies.

# Creating a Virtual Environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Installing Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Docker Setup
If you prefer to run the application in a Docker container, follow these steps:

# Building the Docker Image:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t fruit-classification .

# Running the Docker Container:

bash
Copy code
docker run -it --rm -p 80:80 fruit-classification
Running the Application
Running Locally

# Activate your virtual environment and run the script:

bash
Copy code
python fruit_classification.py
Running with Docker
Once the Docker container is up, it will automatically start the application. You can interact with it via the exposed port (default: 80).

# Usage Guide
The application classifies fruits based on images provided. Here’s how to use it:

# Uploading an Image:

Navigate to the appropriate section of the application interface.
Use the upload button to select an image file of the fruit.

# Getting Predictions:
After uploading, the system will process the image and provide a classification label along with a confidence score.

# Interpreting Results:
The output will display the predicted fruit type and the confidence percentage.

# Troubleshooting
Issue: Application not starting:

Solution: Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed and the Python version is compatible.
Issue: Docker container fails to build:

Solution: Check the Dockerfile and ensure all necessary files are present and correctly referenced.
Issue: Incorrect predictions:

Solution: Verify that the input image quality is adequate and the model has been correctly trained.
